# Global View

The Global View allows quickly navigating global events and their data. Currently, it boasts two types of events:

1. Errors
   * TODO
2. Console Events
   * TODO

## Debug

The Debug node holds internally used data, usually only used for debugging or understanding Dbux's own behavior.
