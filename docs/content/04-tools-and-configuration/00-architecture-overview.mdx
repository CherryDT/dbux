# Architecture Overview

import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import CodeLink from '@src/components/CodeLink';

<Img darkLight={false} src="architecture-v001.png" />

The [Dbux monorepo](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux) includes the following modules:

* <CodeLink pkg="dbux-babel-plugin" /> instruments and injects <CodeLink pkg="dbux-runtime" /> into a given js program when supplied as a `plugin` to Babel.
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/runtime" /> When an instrumented program runs, this module is responsible for recording and sending runtime data to the `@dbux/data` module, running on a receiving server (using `socket-io.client`). [The Dbux VSCode plugin](./dbux-code) hosts such a server.
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/cli" /> The cli (command-line interface) allows us to easily run a js program while instrumenting it on the fly using [@babel/register](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register).
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/graph-common" />, <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/graph-client" /> and <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/graph-host" /> Are responsible for rendering and letting the user interact with the "Call Graph" through an HTML GUI.


## Utilities and Libraries

* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/common" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all other modules.
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/common-node" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all node-only modules.
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/data" /> Receives, pre-processes and manages all data sent by `@dbux/runtime`. It allows us to query and analyze JS runtime data on a higher level.
* [`dbux-code`](./dbux-code) The Dbux VSCode extension ([VSCode marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Domi.dbux-code)).
* <CodeLink pkg="@dbux/projects" /> Used by `dbux-code` as part of [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) (but does not depend on `VSCode`). It is used to organize real-world projects, their bugs and practice exercises.
