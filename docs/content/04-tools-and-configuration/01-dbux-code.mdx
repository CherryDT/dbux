## Runtime Server

TODO(pic)

Currently, the Dbux VSCode Extension is the only implementation of the Dbux Runtime Server. If enabled, it receives data from applications running on `localhost`[^1]. Once a first batch of data is received, the application will show up in the [Application View](../using-dbux/applications).

Also see: [Dbux Architecture](../advanced/architecture).


## Commands

TODO

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) [can be key-bound](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
