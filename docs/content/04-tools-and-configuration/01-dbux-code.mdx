import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline'

<!-- NOTE: we want a TOC on the side, but not inline. -->

## Runtime Server

TODO(pic)

Currently, the Dbux VSCode Extension is the only implementation of the Dbux Runtime Server. If enabled, it receives data from applications running on `localhost`[^1]. Once a first batch of data is received, the application will show up in the [Application View](../using-dbux/overview#application-view).

Also see: [Dbux Architecture](../advanced/architecture).


## Config

TODO

[^1]: This is a [known limitation](../advanced/known-limitations).
