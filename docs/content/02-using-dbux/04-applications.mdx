# Application View

This view lists all recorded applications. Applications of the same entry point are grouped together.

TODO(pics -> show multiple applications, some nested, some activated, also show "go to entry point" button)

* You can enable/disable each application manually. If an application is disabled (no checkmark), you cannot interact with it: its code is not augmented, its traces cannot be selected or searched, and it does not show up in the call graph.
* You can use the arrow button to the right of every application to go to its entry point.

:::note
If your application does not show up here, you cannot analyze it. In that case, please [refer to our FAQ](../faq#my-applications-dont-show-up).

:::tip
This is not a crucial analysis view. We recommend minimizing it unless you really need it.
