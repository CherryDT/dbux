# Code Augmentation + Select Trace

When browsing executed code, you should see code augmentations, like this:

TODO(pic)

You can investigate the details of the execution of a piece of code via trace selection:

* Place the keyboard cursor on a piece of code that has executed.
  * NOTE: Usually, executed code is [visually augmented](./code-augmentation).
* You should see the red crosshair<DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> show up in two places: the top right of the editor window and in the [Trace Details View](./trace-detail)[^1].
* Click the crosshair.
* The [Trace Details View](./trace-details) should pop up and show you all relevant information of the recorded trace in that place of the code.

[^1]: You might need to hover over the `Trace Details View` for buttons to show up. This is a [limitation of the VSCode Extension API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78829).
