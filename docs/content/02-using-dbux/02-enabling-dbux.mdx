# Enabling Dbux

import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), using Dbux involves two steps:

1. [Run an Application with Dbux Enabled](#run-an-application-with-dbux-enabled).
2. Use the Dbux VSCode Extension for [runtime analysis](#runtime-analysis).


## Run an Application with Dbux Enabled

The first step is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled, meaning: the application must be instrumented by [@dbux/babel-plugin](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-babel-plugin) and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-runtime).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](./the-run-button) <DarkLightImg src='play.svg' /> allows you to easily run a simple Node application with Dbux enabled.
2. The [Dbux CLI](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](./the-run-button) work. You can use it directly in order to run any non-bundled Node application.
3. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of real-world applications (some with real-world bugs) at the click of a single button, in order to explore and analyze them.
4. In order to enable Dbux for frontend and other bundled applications the developer needs to manually [integrate Dbux into the project's build pipeline](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).

Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server) where the developer can commence with [runtime analysis](#runtime-analysis).


## Runtime Analysis

Once executed, the recorded application should show up in the [Application View](./application-view).

Once [recorded](#run-an-application-with-dbux-enabled), the Dbux VSCode Extension offers several tools for runtime analysis:

* Use the [Application View](./applications) to go to the Application entry point.
* Get a high-level overview with:
  * the [Global View](./global).
  * the [Call Graph](./call-graph).
* Get down into the nitty-gritty:
  * [Select a Trace](./cast) <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" />.
  * Investigate individual traces using the [Trace Details View](./trace-details)
  * [Navigate](./trace-details#navigation) TODO(pic) between traces.
  * [Search](./search) for traces, contexts, modules or data.
* Understand where data came from and where it went using the [Data Flow View](./data-flow).

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) [can be key-bound](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
