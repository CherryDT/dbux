## Run Application w/ Dbux Enabled

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), the first step of using Dbux is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled. That means that the application must be instrumented and injected with the TODO.
Once.. a target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) allows you to easily run a simple Node application.
2. The [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) work. It should allow you to run any non-bundled Node application.
3. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of frontend, backend (and hopefully soon, full-stack) applications at the click of a single button.
4. Frontend and other bundled applications require [build pipeline integration](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).


## How to Analyze the Result?

First, make sure that the new application shows up in the [Application View](#application-view).

Next, you have several options:

* Use the [Application View](#application-view) to go to Application entry point.
* Low-level investigation via [Select Trace](#select-trace) <ThemedImg src='crosshair_red.svg' /> and [Trace Details View](#trace-details-view).
* Data Flow investigation via the [Data Flow View](#data-flow-view).

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) can be keybound.

## Application View

This view lists all recorded applications. Applications of the same entry point are grouped together.

TODO(pics -> show multiple applications, some nested, some activated, also show "go to entry point" button)

* You can enable/disable each application manually. If disabled (no checkmark), you cannot interact with it. It's code is not augmented, it's traces cannot be selected and it does not show up in the call graph.
* You can use the arrow button to the right of every application to go to its entry point.

:::note
If your application does not show up here, please [refer to our FAQ](../faq#my-applications-dont-show-up).

:::tip
We recommend minimizing this view during analysis to save space.

## Code Augmentation

TODO

## Select Trace

* Place the keyboard cursor on a piece of code that has executed. Usually, executed code is [visually augmented](#code-augmentation).
* You should see the red crosshair <ThemedImg src='crosshair_red.svg' /> show up in two places: the top right of the editor window and in the [Trace Details View](#trace-detail-view).
* Click the crosshair.
* The [Trace Details View](#trace-details-view) should pop up and show you all relevant information of the recorded trace in that place of the code.
