# Using Dbux: Overview

Using Dbux involves two steps:

1. Run an application [with Dbux enabled](#enabling-dbux).
2. Use the Dbux VSCode Extension for [runtime analysis](#runtime-analysis).


## Enabling Dbux

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), the first step of using Dbux is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled. That means that the application must be instrumented and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-runtime).
Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](./the-run-button) allows you to easily run a simple Node application with Dbux enabled.
2. The [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](./the-run-button) work. It should allow you to run any non-bundled Node application.
3. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of frontend, backend (and hopefully soon, full-stack) applications at the click of a single button.
4. Frontend and other bundled applications require [build pipeline integration](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).


Once executed, it should show up in the [Application View](./application-view).


## Runtime Analysis

Once [recorded](#enabling-dbux), the Dbux VSCode Extension offers several tools for runtime analysis:

* Use the [Application View](./applications) to go to the Application entry point.
* Get a high-level overview via:
  * the [Global View](./global).
  * the [Call Graph](./call-graph).
* Get down into the nitty-gritty:
  * [Select a Trace](./code-augmentation-select-trace) <DarkLightImg src='crosshair_red.svg' />.
  * Investigate individual traces using the [Trace Details View](./trace-details)
  * [Navigate](./trace-details#navigation) TODO(pic) between traces.
  * [Search](./search) for traces, contexts, modules or data.
* Understand where data came from and where it went using the [Data Flow View](./data-flow).

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) [can be key-bound](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
