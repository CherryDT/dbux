# Using Dbux: Overview

## Run Application w/ Dbux Enabled

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), the first step of using Dbux is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled. That means that the application must be instrumented and injected with the TODO.
Once.. a target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) allows you to easily run a simple Node application.
3. The [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) work. It should allow you to run any non-bundled Node application.
2. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of frontend, backend (and hopefully soon, full-stack) applications at the click of a single button.
4. Frontend and other bundled applications require [build pipeline integration](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).
