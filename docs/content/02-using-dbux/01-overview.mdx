## Runtime Analysis w/ Dbux

Using Dbux involves three steps:

1. Run an application [with Dbux enabled](#enabling-dbux).
2. Make sure that the new application shows up in the [Application View](#application-view).
3. Start your analysis...

The Dbux UI offers several tools for runtime analysis:

* Use the [Application View](#application-view) to go to the Application entry point.
* Get a high-level overview via:
  * the [Call Graph](#call-graph).
  * the [Global View](#global-view).
* Get down into the nitty-gritty:
  * [Select a Trace](#select-trace) <DarkLightImg src='crosshair_red.svg' />
  * Investigate individual traces using the [Trace Details View](#trace-details-view)
  * [Navigate](#navigation) TODO(pic) between traces.
  * [Search](#search) for traces, contexts, modules or data.
* Understand where data came from and where it went using the [Data Flow View](#data-flow-view).

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) can be keybound.

## Enabling Dbux

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), the first step of using Dbux is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled. That means that the application must be instrumented and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-runtime).
Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](./the-run-button) allows you to easily run a simple Node application.
2. The [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](./the-run-button) work. It should allow you to run any non-bundled Node application.
3. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of frontend, backend (and hopefully soon, full-stack) applications at the click of a single button.
4. Frontend and other bundled applications require [build pipeline integration](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).


## Application View

This view lists all recorded applications. Applications of the same entry point are grouped together.

TODO(pics -> show multiple applications, some nested, some activated, also show "go to entry point" button)

* You can enable/disable each application manually. If an application is disabled (no checkmark), you cannot interact with it. It's code is not augmented, it's traces cannot be selected and it does not show up in the call graph.
* You can use the arrow button to the right of every application to go to its entry point.

:::note
If your application does not show up, please [refer to our FAQ](../faq#my-applications-dont-show-up).

:::tip
This is not a crucial analysis view. We recommend minimizing it unless you really need it.

## Code Augmentation

TODO

## Select Trace

* Place the keyboard cursor on a piece of code that has executed. Usually, executed code is [visually augmented](#code-augmentation).
* You should see the red crosshair <DarkLightImg src='crosshair_red.svg' /> show up in two places: the top right of the editor window and in the [Trace Details View](#trace-detail-view).
* Click the crosshair.
* The [Trace Details View](#trace-details-view) should pop up and show you all relevant information of the recorded trace in that place of the code.
