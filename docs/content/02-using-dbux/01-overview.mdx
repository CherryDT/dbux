# Using Dbux: Overview

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline'

<!-- NOTE: we want a TOC on the side, but not inline. -->
<!-- see https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/inline-toc -->
<div style={{display: 'none'}}>
  <TOCInline toc={toc} />
</div>

## Run Application w/ Dbux Enabled

Once [installed](../getting-started/installation), the first step to using Dbux is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled. Once instrumented and injected, a target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server].

These are the primary approaches to achieve this goal:

1. [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) allows you to easily run a simple Node application.
3. The [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](../getting-started/the-run-button) work. It should allow you to run any non-bundled Node application.
2. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of frontend, backend (and hopefully soon, full-stack) applications at the click of a single button.
4. Frontend and other bundled applications require [build pipeline integration](../tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).
