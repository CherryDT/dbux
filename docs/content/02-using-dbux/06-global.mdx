# Global View

The Global View allows quickly navigating global events and their data. Currently, it boasts two types of events:

## Errors
TODO


## Console Events
TODO


## Modules

TODO


## Debug

The Debug node holds internally used data, usually only used for debugging or understanding Dbux's own behavior.
