# Select Trace

import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';
import Term from '@src/components/Term';


You can investigate the <Term term="trace">trace log</Term> of executed code using the "Select Trace" <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> button:

* Place the keyboard cursor on a piece of code that has executed.
  * You should see the red crosshair <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> show up in two places: the top right of the editor window and in the [Trace Details View](./trace-details)[^1].
  * NOTE: Most executed code is [visually augmented](#code-augmentation) <span className='color-red'> ↳ ↱ </span><span className='color-gray'>↳</span> <span className='color-orange'>ƒ</span>.
* Click the crosshair <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" />.
* The [Trace Details View](./trace-details) should now offer a wide array of relevant information regarding the selected piece of code.


TODO(pic)

:::caution
A piece of code might have [executed multiple times](./trace-details#executions). Make sure to select the "right" execution (or find it first) before drawing conclusions.
:::

[^1]: You might need to hover over the `Trace Details View` for buttons to show up. This is a [limitation of the VSCode Extension API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78829).
