## Runtime Server

Currently, the Dbux VSCode Extension offers the only implementation of the Dbux ðŸ“¡ Runtime Server. If enabled, it receives data from applications running on `localhost`[^1]. Once a first batch of data is received, the application will show up in the [Application View](../using-dbux/applications).

The Runtime Server turns on automatically the first time you use [the Run Button](../02-using-dbux/03-the-run-button.mdx) or run a [Dbux Practice exercise](../03-dbux-practice/01-overview.mdx). In any other case, you need to turn it on manually. The button is located at the top of [the Applications view](../02-using-dbux/06-applications.mdx)[^2]:

[^1]: We currently only support `localhost` for analysis. Fixing this shortcoming is part of our planned [future work](../advanced/future-work).
[^2]: You might need to hover over the `Applications` view for buttons to show up. This is a [limitation of the VSCode Extension API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78829).
