# Code Decorations

import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import CodeLink from '@src/components/CodeLink';
import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';


* After [executing a piece of code with Dbux enabled](./02-enable-dbux.mdx), all executed code is decorated <span className='color-red'>↳ ↱</span> <span className='color-gray'>↳</span> <span className='color-orange'>ƒ</span>.
* These decorations allow us to better understand which parts of the code actually executed.
* You can toggle decorations via the `Dbux: Hide Decorations` and `Dbux: Show Decorations` commands.
  * <Img screen src="toggle-deco.png" />

## Examples

* `f()` <span className="color-red">↱</span>: the function `f` is recorded and we can step into it.
* `g()` <span className="color-gray">↱</span>: the function `g` is not recorded and we cannot step into it.

In this buggy code, we find that line 6 never executed, just from the code decorations:

For all code decorations and their meanings, please refer to <CodeLink path="dbux-code/src/codeDeco/traceDecoConfig.js" />.
