# Application View

import Term from '@src/components/Term';

This view lists all recorded applications. Applications of the same entry point are grouped together.

<!-- TODO(pics -> show multiple applications, some nested, some activated, also show "go to entry point" button) -->

* You can enable/disable each application manually. If an application is disabled (no checkmark), you cannot interact with it: its code is not augmented, its traces cannot be selected or searched, and it does not show up in the call graph.
* You can use the arrow button to the right of every application to go to its entry point.
* Activating multiple applications at once can be useful for full-stack debugging purposes.
   * When multiple applications are enabled at the same time, their <Term term="cgr">call graph roots</Term> are merged onto a single timeline, allowing their data to be inspected together and (to some extent) correlated.

:::caution
If your application does not show up here, you cannot analyze it. If that happens to you, please [refer to our FAQ](../08-faq.mdx#my-applications-dont-show-up).

:::tip
This view is not crucial for most analysis tasks. We recommend minimizing it unless you really need it.
