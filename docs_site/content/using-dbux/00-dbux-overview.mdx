## Dbux Architecture

As of 01/2022, Dbux consists of four applications and six supplementary modules, as depicted below:

<Img src="architecture-v001.png" />

Dbux's three stages \textit{instrument}, \textit{runtime} and \textit{post-processing} are implemented in four collaborating applications:

TODO: change CodeLink to ToolLink

* <CodeLink path="dbux-babel-plugin" /> instruments and injects <CodeLink path="dbux-runtime" /> a given application.
* <CodeLink path="dbux-runtime" /> When an instrumented program runs, this module is responsible for recording and sending runtime data to the `@dbux/data` module, running on a receiving server (using `socket-io.client`).
* The Dbux VSCode Extension is one-click-installable from the VSCode Marketplace. It hosts the run-time server to receive the data produced by \code{dbux-runtime}. When data is received it is post-processed with the help of the \code{dbux-data} module before allowing the user to investigate it. Data is processed and presented in real-time, meaning that applications can be debugged while they are still running.
* <CodeLink path="dbux-cli" /> allows executing a Node application with Dbux enabled using [@babel/register](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register).


### Utilities and Libraries

Several utilities and libraries are also part of the [Dbux Monorepo](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux):

* <CodeLink path="dbux-graph-common" />, <CodeLink path="dbux-graph-client" /> and <CodeLink path="dbux-graph-host" /> are responsible for rendering and letting the user interact with the "Call Graph" through an HTML GUI.
* <CodeLink path="dbux-data" /> Receives, pre-processes and manages all data sent by `@dbux/runtime`. It allows us to query and analyze JS runtime data on a higher level.
* [`dbux-code`](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-code) The Dbux VSCode extension ([VSCode marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Domi.dbux-code)).
* <CodeLink path="dbux-projects" /> Used by `dbux-code` as part of [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) (but does not depend on `VSCode`). It is used to organize real-world projects, their bugs and practice exercises.
* <CodeLink path="dbux-common" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all other modules.
* <CodeLink path="dbux-common-node" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all node-only modules.


## Runtime Analysis

You can analyze your application using the [Dbux VSCode Extension](../tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx) (which is currently the only GUI implementation for Dbux).

Once executed, the recorded application should show up in the [Application View](./using-dbux/applications).
Once the application shows up, you can use the following tools for analysis:

* Use the [Application View](./using-dbux/applications) to go to the Application entry point.
* Get a high-level overview with:
  * the [Global View](./using-dbux/global).
  * the [Call Graph](./using-dbux/call-graph).
* Get down into the nitty-gritty:
  * &#8203<DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> [Select a Trace](./05-select-trace.mdx).
  * Investigate individual traces using the [Trace Details View](./using-dbux/trace-details).
  * &#8203<DarkLightImg width="24px" src="nextInContext.svg" /> <DarkLightImg width="24px" src="previousInContext.svg" /> [Navigate](./using-dbux/trace-details#navigation) between traces.
  * [Search](./using-dbux/search) for traces, contexts, modules or data.
* Understand where data came from and where it went using the [Data Flow View](./using-dbux/data-flow).

:::tip
All buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding [commands](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#commands) which in turn (are not by default but) [can be key-bound](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
