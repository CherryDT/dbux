Once [installed](./using-dbux/installation), using Dbux involves two steps:

1. Run an Application with Dbux enabled (explained below).
2. Use the Dbux VSCode Extension for [runtime analysis](./00-dbux-overview.mdx#runtime-analysis).


## Run an Application with Dbux Enabled

The first step is to execute a JS application with Dbux enabled, meaning: the application must be instrumented by [@dbux/babel-plugin](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-babel-plugin) and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-runtime).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](./using-dbux/the-run-button) <DarkLightImg src='play.svg' /> allows you to easily run a simple Node application with Dbux enabled.
2. The [Dbux CLI](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](./using-dbux/the-run-button) work. You can use it directly in order to run any non-bundled Node application.
3. [Dbux Practice](./dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of real-world applications (some with real-world bugs) at the click of a single button, in order to explore and analyze them.
4. In order to enable Dbux for frontend and other bundled applications the developer needs to manually [integrate Dbux into the project's build pipeline](./tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).

Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server) where the developer can commence with [runtime analysis](./00-dbux-overview.mdx#runtime-analysis).
