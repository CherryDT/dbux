<!-- ## Run an Application with Dbux Enabled -->

Before you can [analyze](./00-dbux-overview.mdx#runtime-analysis) an application, you must first execute it with Dbux enabled. This means, the application must be instrumented by [@dbux/babel-plugin](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-babel-plugin) and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-runtime).

There are four different ways to run an application with Dbux enabled:

1. [The Run Button](./using-dbux/the-run-button) <DarkLightImg src='play.svg' /> allows you to easily run a simple Node application with Dbux enabled.
2. The [Dbux CLI](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-cli) provides the magic that makes [The Run Button](./using-dbux/the-run-button) work. You can use it directly in order to run Node applications from a terminal or command-line window.
3. [Dbux Practice](./dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of real-world applications (some with real-world bugs) at the click of a single button.
4. In order to enable Dbux for frontend and other bundled applications the developer needs to manually [integrate Dbux into the project's build pipeline](./tools-and-configuration/build-pipeline-integration).

Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](./tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server) where the developer can commence with [runtime analysis](./00-dbux-overview.mdx#runtime-analysis).
