# Data Flow View {#data-flow}

<!-- import TOC from '@src/components/TOC';

<TOC toc={toc} /> -->

After selecting a value, this view lists all traces containing it.

Values can have two types of identities TODO, which you can select:

1. The value itself.
2. The variable that holds them.

TODO: explain

TODO: `trace` vs. `DataNode`

TODO: "origin trace"
