# Dbux Data Analysis

import CodeLink from '@src/components/CodeLink';

`@dbux/runtime` collects fine-grained JavaScript runtime data, which is then received by the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server), where it gets stored in memory. If you are interested in analyzing this data programmatically:

1. You generally want to start by exporting the data. You can get the data using the `"Dbux: Export Application Data"` command[^1].
2. <CodeLink path="dbux-data" /> is our main data processing JavaScript package. We use it to preprocess and manage all runtime data. <CodeLink path="dbux-code" /> uses its preprocessed data for visualization and user interactions.
3. <CodeLink path="analysis" /> contains a few Python functions and notebooks for rudimentary analysis on extracted data for testing and development purposes. NOTE: This approach is not matured and, unlike `@dbux/data`, has almost no Dbux-specific data processing utilities.

In summary: If you want to try custom data analysis on Dbux data, we strongly recommend using `@dbux/data`, but other approaches can of course work just as well. Make sure to give it a good try, and feel free to complain or otherwise report back to us on the [Dbux DISCORD](https://discord.gg/QKgq9ZE).

## Python Experiments

In the `analyze/` folder, you find several python notebooks that allow you analyze the data that `dbux` generates. Here is how you set that up:

1. Run some program with Dbux enabled (e.g. `samples/[...]/oop1.js`)
2. In VSCode `Run Command` (`CTRL/Command + SHIFT + P`) -> `Dbux: Export Application Data`
3. Make sure you have Python + Jupyter setup
   * Windows
      * [Install `Anaconda` with `chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3)
      * Set your `%PYTHONPATH%` in system config to your Anaconda `Lib` + `DLLs` folders (e.g. `C:\tools\Anaconda3\Lib;C:\tools\Anaconda3\DLLs;`)
      * Done!
   * TODO: Other OS'es
4. Run one of the notebooks, load the file, and analyze.

NOTE: this is not currently well maintained. Make sure to [reach out](https://discord.gg/QKgq9ZE), if things go wrong.
