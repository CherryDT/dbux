Dbux provides several tools for manual data analysis. However, this page explains how to use **advanced data analysis tools and techniques**.

1. You probably want to start by exporting the data, using the `"Dbux: Export Application Data"` command[^1].
2. &#8203<CodeLink path="dbux-data" /> is our main data processing JavaScript package. We use it to preprocess and manage all runtime data. <CodeLink path="dbux-code" /> uses <CodeLink path="dbux-data" />'s preprocessed data for visualization and user interactions.
4. &#8203<CodeLink path="analysis" /> contains a few Python functions and example notebooks that use extracted data for testing and development purposes. NOTE: This package is not matured and, unlike `@dbux/data`, has almost no Dbux-specific data processing utilities. More details [below](#python-experiments).

Make sure to give it a good try, and feel free to complain or otherwise report back to us on the [Dbux DISCORD](https://discord.gg/QKgq9ZE).


## Python Experiments

In the `analyze/` folder, you find several example notebooks that allow you to analyze the data that `dbux` generates. Here is how you set that up:

1. Run some program with Dbux enabled (e.g. `samples/[...]/oop1.js`)
2. In VSCode `Run Command` (`CTRL/Command + SHIFT + P`) -> `Dbux: Export Application Data`
3. Make sure you have Python + Jupyter setup
   * Windows
      1. [Install `Anaconda` with `chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3)
      1. Set your `%PYTHONPATH%` in system config to your Anaconda `Lib` + `DLLs` folders (e.g. `C:\tools\Anaconda3\Lib;C:\tools\Anaconda3\DLLs;`)
      1. Done!
   * TODO: Other OS'es
4. Run one of the notebooks, load the file, and analyze.

NOTE: this is not currently well maintained. Make sure to [reach out](https://discord.gg/QKgq9ZE), if things go wrong.

PS: If you want more/better support for automatic data analysis, please let us know on Discord and also feel free to up-vote [this issue](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/issues/208).
