# Performance

There are many performance considerations in tracing and recording *all* activity of a program.

Main considerations include:

* Instrumentation can be slow.
  * `@dbux/cli` uses [`@babel/register`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register) with custom caching. That caching currently has limited configuration, but we hope for more in the future.
  * If you use a bundler, make sure to configure caching for it.
* When executing *a lot of stuff* (e.g. long loops or high FPS games etc), things will get slow
  * For example: Dbux probably won't really work at all if you run it on a 30+FPS game.
    * In that case, we might want to be very strategic in telling Dbux to only record: (i) initialization, (ii) a select few other functions and then (iii) several frames of the gameloop for our analysis.
  * Again, adaptive tracing is something we want to do in the future.
* When running a program with Dbux enabled, and also running it in debug mode in Node (i.e. `--inspect` or `--inspect-brk`), things slow down even worse. When things get too slow, you might want to consider using the `Run` button instead of the `Debug` button, and use the Dbux built-in features for debugging; unless there are some features in the traditional debugger that you just cannot live without in some specific circumstances.
* Recording of large arrays and objects is limited, according to some (currently hardcoded) `SerializationLimits`, to be found in [valueCollection](dbux-runtime/src/data/valueCollection.js).
