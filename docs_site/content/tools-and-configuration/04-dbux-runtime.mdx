<CodeLink path="dbux-babel-plugin" /> is injected by the [@dbux/babel-plugin](./dbux-babel-plugin) in order to record a JavaScript application's runtime trace log.

Once running, it is responsible for collecting and sending runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).
