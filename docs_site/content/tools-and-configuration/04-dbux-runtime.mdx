<TOC toc={toc} />

The Dbux Runtime ([@dbux/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dbux/runtime)) is injected by the [@dbux/babel-plugin](./dbux-babel-plugin) in order to record a JavaScript application's execution trace.
Once running, it is responsible for collection and sending execution to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/dbux-code#runtime-server).
