## Code of Conduct

## Development + Contributing: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* `bash`
   * On Windows, you can get this via cygwin or `git` (which also installs cygwin)
* Recommended: [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)
  * Please consider the [installation chapter](../runtime-analysis/01-installation.mdx#system-requirements) for pros, cons and installation instructions.
* `yarn`
* `Node@16`


### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Domiii/dbux.git
cd dbux
code dbux.code-workspace # open project in vscode
yarn install && yarn i # install dependencies
```

Finally, you might want to enable Dbux auto start by default:

<Img screen src="dbux-auto-start-workspace-setting.png" />


If dependencies bug out, sometimes running the (very aggressive) clean-up command can help: `npm run dbux-reinstall`.
Of course, we don't recommend this, unless absolutely necessary. It will delete your `yarn.lock` file, which can lead to installation of package versions that have breaking changes in them, potentially introducing even more problems.


### Start Development

1. Open project + start build+watch mode
   ```sh
   code dbux.code-workspace # open project in vscode
   yarn start # start webpack development build of all projects in watch mode
   ```
2. Go to your VSCode debug tab, select the `dbux-code` configuration and press F5. This runs the [Dbux VSCode Extension](../tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx) in debug mode.
3. Inside the new window, you can then use [Dbux VSCode Extension](../tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx) as usual (but in debug mode).


### Adding dependencies

We use Lerna with Yarn workspaces, so instead of `npm install pkg`, we do the following:

* Adding `pkg` to `@dbux/something` (where `dbux-something` is the folder containing the package `@dbux/something`):
   `npx lerna add --scope=@dbux/something pkg`
   `npx lerna add --scope=@dbux/common pkg`
   `npx lerna add --scope=dbux-code pkg      # note: dbux-code's package name has a dash (-), not a slash (/)!`
* Adding `pkg` to the root's `devDependencies`:
   `yarn add --dev -W pkg`


<!-- ### Local Development Build

If you want to use the local development build of Dbux in other folders, make sure to hard-link them.

E.g. on Windows:

```ps
mkdir ..\..\node_modules\@dbux
mklink /J ..\..\node_modules\@dbux\babel-plugin ..\..\..\dbux\dbux-babel-plugin
mklink /J ..\..\node_modules\@dbux\runtime ..\..\..\dbux\dbux-runtime
``` -->


## Joining the Community

While you can certainly try to get started on your own, you probably make your life a lot easier by [join the dev team on Discord](https://discord.gg/8kR2a7h) first :)


## Documentation: docs_site

We use `docusaurus` for documentation.

* `cd docs_site`
* `yarn start`


### Build + Deploy docs

* `yarn build`
  * -> Make sure, there are no build problems.
* `yarn serve`
  * This serves the production build locally to allow you manually test and check whether the documentation site works correctly.
  * You especially want to do this when introducing new complex logic or components.
* `yarn deploy`
  * Make the changes go live.

### Known Problems + Related Issues

See https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/issues/632 and https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/labels/documentation.


### Local Development Build

When trying to use a local Dbux dev build, we recommend using `yalc`:

* In your local dbux folder: run `yarn yalc`
* Might have to use `npm` in target project (it seems to bug out with `yarn`)
* `yalc add --dev @dbux/babel-plugin @dbux/runtime @dbux/cli @dbux/common @dbux/common-node @dbux/babel-register-fork`
* Sometimes, the build cache needs to be flushed
  * E.g. when using `webpack` and `babel`: `rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/babel-loader`


See https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/issues/661.



## Unsorted Notes

### VSCode extension development

#### Adding a command/button

(VSCode's buttons are representation of commands, you must add a command before adding a button)

1. Register command in `contributes.commands` section of package.json as following(title and icon are optional):

    ``` json
    {
      "commands": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "title": "<TITLE>",
          "icon": {
            "light": "<PATH_TO_YOUR_ICON>",
            "dark": "<PATH_TO_YOUR_ICON>"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Bind the command with a callback function in js file:

    ``` js
    import { registerCommand } from './commands/commandUtil';
    registerCommand(context, '<COMMAND_ID>', callback);
    ```

1. Depends on whether the command should be shown in command palette, add the following to `contributes.menus.commandPalette` section in package.json:

    Show command in command palette
    (use `"when": "!dbux.context.activated"` instead if you want show it before dbux has been activated)

    ``` json
    {
      "commantPalette": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "when": "dbux.context.activated"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Hide command from command palette

    ``` json
    {
      "commantPalette": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "when": "false"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Finally, configure where the button should be shown(skip this step if you don't want a button):

    To show button in...

    - navigation bar(upper-right corner), add the following to `contributes.menus.editor/title`
    
    ``` json
    {
      "editor/title": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "when": "dbux.context.activated",
          "group": "navigation"
        } 
      ] 
    }
    ```

    - tree view title, add the following to `contributes.menus.view/title`
      ( `<VIEW_ID>` is defined in `contributes.views.dbuxViewContainer` section)

    ``` json
    {
      "view/title": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "when": "view == <VIEW_ID>",
          "group": "navigation"
        } 
      ] 
    }
    ```

    - tree view item, add the following to `contributes.menus.view/item/context`
      ( `<VIEW_ID>` is defined in `contributes.views.dbuxViewContainer` section and `<NODE_CONTEXT_ID>` is defined programmatically in `TreeItem.contextValue` )

    ``` json
    {
      "view/item/context": [
        {
          "command": "<COMMAND_ID>",
          "when": "view == <VIEW_ID> && viewItem == <NODE_CONTEXT_ID>",
          "group": "inline"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    NOTES:

    - You can sort buttons by adding suffix `@<number>` to `group` property. e.g. `"group": "inline@5"`
    - If you remove `"group": "navigation"` , the button will be listed in a dropdown menu, see [Sorting of groups](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#Sorting-of-groups) for more information
    - The `when` property defines when should the button be visible, see ['when' clause contexts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts) for more available condition

## How to use Dbux on Dbux?

TODO: we have not fully added support for this yet.

<!-- 
### How to "dbux" dbux-runtime?

#### Build it

â†’ We need a new version of `@dbux/runtime` that is built with and records things with `@dbux/runtime`. We call it the "incep" (short for "inception") version.

1. Set `@dbux/babel-plugin`'s cfg's `runtime.global` to `__dbux_incep__`
2. Add two new configs to `@dbux/runtime`'s `webpack` and add `@dbux/babel-plugin` to them: `index-${target}-incep`

#### Run it

1. Fix build/register pipelines:
   * `@dbux/cli` needs to allow customizing the `@dbux/runtime` being used.
   * webpack and other bundlers need to easily be able to load the `incep`, rather than the standard version.
2. Run it!
   * You should now see two different applications pop up in your Dbux frontend (e.g. `dbux-code`).
