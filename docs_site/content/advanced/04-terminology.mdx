This page lists some Dbux's own terminology. More general terminology and background can be found in the [Background and Related Work](../background) chapter.

## Trace

We use (i) the name `staticTrace` to represent a piece of code (e.g. `f(x)`), and (ii) the name `trace` to represent a recorded execution of that code; meaning that one `staticTrace` (piece of code) has 0 or more `traces` (executions).

:::info
In runtime analysis research, the term "trace" usually refers to the entire runtime log. We, on the other hand, use it as a shorthand for "trace record" (or "trace entry"), referring to an individual log entry, rather than all entries.

## Context

* A `static context` can be a `function` declaration or a `Program` (`Program` is Babel's word for "JavaScript file").
* A `context` (sometimes also called `executionContext`) is any execution of such function or Program.
* In many ways, a `context` can also be considered a "stack frame", but it is not quite the same.
* On file contexts:
  * While functions can be executed many times, JavaScript files usually only execute once, that is the first time they are `require`'d or `import`'ed.
  * After that first time, their `exports` are cached, and returned to any following caller of `require` or `import`.
  * That is why you will only see a single trace in the file scope, even if you require them many times.
* TODO: explain virtual and async contexts
