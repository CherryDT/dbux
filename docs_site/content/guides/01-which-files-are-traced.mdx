# Which Files are Traced?

This article explains Dbux determines which files to record.

When [Dbux is enabled](../using-dbux/02-enable-dbux.mdx), it automatically records execution of all files that are not in `node_modules`[^1]. It is a balancing act to determine the optimal set of files to trace. Often times it is easiest to tell Dbux to just trace everything. However, tracing *everything* can slow down the build/parse time significantly.

<!-- TODO(re-write this: build-time vs. run-time performance considerations etc.)

Also, tracing long-running loops or high-FPS code TODO(explain). That is why you want to fine-tune configuration as to what and how you want to trace.  -->


Dbux currently offers several configuration options:

* `packageWhitelist`
* `packageBlacklist`
* `fileWhitelist`
* `fileBlacklist`

* -> These settings are in <CodeLink path="dbux-babel-plugin/src/external/moduleFilter.js" />.
* -> Package name is determined via <CodeLink path="dbux-common-node/src/util/moduleUtil.js">`parsePackageName`</CodeLink>


[^1]: Support for PnP and other module systems are [pending](../advanced/02-future-work.mdx).
