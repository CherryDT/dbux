## Call Graph

Dbux records and visualizes the **Dynamic Call Graph** of JavaScript applications.

TODO: a lot more to be said here.


### Call Graph Roots (CGR) {#cgr}

A "call graph root" (CGR) is an invocation of code from outside our visible (recorded) runtime. Examples include:

* Your application's entry point.
* Execution of a JavaScript file, often called by `node` or by the webpack bundle (which in turn is called by the underlying JS runtime environment).
* Browser executing a &lt;script> tag.
* Execution of a callback supplied to `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setIntermediate`, `Process.nextTick`, `Promise.then` etc. These callbacks are scheduled and then, at a later point in time, executed by the underlying JS runtime environment.
* DOM or OS event handler callbacks.
* and more...

:::tip
The *synchronous* [call graph](../using-dbux/08-call-graph.mdx) lists all CGRs on a linear timeline.
The nodes of the *asynchronous* [call graph](../using-dbux/08-call-graph.mdx) only comprises call graph roots.
