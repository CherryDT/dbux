# Global View

import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';

The Global View allows quickly navigating global events and their data, including:

TODO(screenshots)

## Errors

Lists all thrown errors in the program. The children of each node are stack frames that were interrupted by this error:

TODO(screenshot)

In case of errors, the `Error button` <DarkLightImg src="fire.svg" /> also shows up in two places:
* At the top right in VSCode (to the right of the editor tabs).
* At the top of the `Global` view.

When you click the `Error button` <DarkLightImg src="fire.svg" />, it takes you right to the recorded error location in code.
If there are multiple errors, you can click it multiple times to toggle through all of them.


:::caution
The "interrupted stack frame" children might be incorrect when multiple errors occur on the same stack[^1].
:::


## Console

Lists all console output events, such as `console.debug`, `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error` etc.
Clicking each event, takes you to the code where the event was recorded.

:::tip
Hover over each node to see the complete message, as well as the code that triggered it and its location.
:::

## Modules

Lists all executed packages and all their executed files/modules/script-tags.

* `(application)` is our own application's code.
* Packages and files are (by default) ordered by first time of execution (except for "`(application)`").

:::note
The above screenshot features `debug` twice. That is because the application loaded `debug` twice, each from two different locations ([more info here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42147243/how-does-npm-handle-version-conflicts)). Often times, this is not going to cause any trouble, but it has the potential to cause dependency conflicts since modules/packages should be uniquely identifiable by their name. Dbux can help discover these types of issues.

## Debug

The Debug node holds internally used data, usually only used for debugging or understanding Dbux's own behavior.
