## Errors

Lists all thrown errors in the program. The children of each node are stack frames that were interrupted by this error:

TODO(screen)

In case of errors, the `Error button` <DarkLightImg src="fire.svg" /> also shows up in two places:
* At the top right in VSCode (to the right of the editor tabs).
* At the top of the `Global` view.

When you click the `Error button` <DarkLightImg src="fire.svg" />, it takes you right to the recorded error location in code.
If there are multiple errors, you can click it multiple times to toggle through all of them.


:::caution
The "interrupted stack frame" children might be incorrect when multiple errors occur on the same stack[^1].

## Console

Lists all console output events, such as `console.debug`, `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error` etc.
Clicking each event, takes you to the code where the event was recorded.
